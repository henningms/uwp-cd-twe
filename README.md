# CDTV / T-We Web wrapper with Picture-in-Picture / Compact Overlay

This is not an official app or anything. I just needed a picture-in-picture / overlay app so I could watch Australian Open on Eurosport via my Canal Digital T-We subscription. If you have the same need and want a crude solution to it? Then go to "Releases" and download the .appxbundle file and install it on your machine. At your own risk.

## How to use

Download the dependencies (either x64 or x86) and then install the .appxbundle file. Should be ready to go. Open the app. Navigate to what you want. If it's a live channel, video or whatever. Remember that you have to be a Canal Digital / T-We customer for this to work. This is NOT a hack for getting free shit. So, when you have started playback of what you wanted, click the fullscreen button on the player and then click the white button at the bottom of the screen to make it go Picture-in-Picture.

## Donations? Nah

But if you did enjoy this little piece of software and you REALLY.. and I mean REALLY want to donate to me then I won't stop you.
