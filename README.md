# CDTV / T-We Web wrapper with Picture-in-Picture / Compact Overlay

This is not an official app or anything. I just needed a picture-in-picture / overlay app so I could watch Australian Open on Eurosport via my Canal Digital T-We subscription. If you have the same need and want a crude solution to it? Then go to "Releases" and download the .appxbundle file and install it on your machine. At your own risk.

## Donations? Nah

But if you did enjoy this little piece of software and you REALLY.. and I mean REALLY want to donate to me then I won't stop you.
